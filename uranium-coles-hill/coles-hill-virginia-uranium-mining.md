Sources for information are NC Division of Transportation, United States Geological Survey and actual field surveys conducted by North Carolina and South Carolina Licensed Surveyors that have been approved and recoded in their respective counties. This file shows some of the boundaries of counties which have a completed boundary survey but the majority of lines have not been surveyed. Also some boundaries cannot be surveyed in cases where boundaries are coincident with river centers. Most of the lines currently are from the DOT county maps which originally come from USGS but might have been updated by the county parcel maps.
