{"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-76.0012088328434, 37.01274032352758]}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"CATEGORY": "Changes to animal species", "LAST_OBSER": "2014", "OBJECTID": 3, "OBSERVER": "Andy Dunton", "FIRST_OBSE": "1947", "DESCRIPTION": "There have been new species arrivals and changes in previously seen species: Speckled trout are now seen year round, as are Puppy drum.  Tarpon first arrived in 1965-66 and are now seen every summer; the number of black sea urchins has grown substantially; grouper are now caught here in summer; Triple Tail are moving north from the Carolinas, but Gray Trout counts are declining; seal counts are up; non-breeding Pelicans and Brandt geese stay longer in our region, but there are fewer Brandts than in previous years. Coyotes have been sighted in Northampton County; mink are no longer seen; and deer numbers increased exponentially since 1947 when there was no deer season. Marsh rail numbers have been steady, but the quail population is much lower than in previous years."}}
